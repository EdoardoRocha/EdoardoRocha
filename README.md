### Welcome to my world 👋
I'm a web development student looking for opportunities and collaboration on projects related to nodejs and deep learning.
- 🔭 I'm currently studying nodejs and javaScript (in addition, I'm improving my skills with programming logic and algorithms regularly).
- 🌱 I am currently learning data optimization security techniques and deep learning using Vue.js.
- 🤝 I'm looking to collaborate on projects creating "Backends" and deep learning.
